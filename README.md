# PacificStormAllies1.X
These are the files/file structures I used when building PSA 1.7 and 1.8.  Since I've moved on to working on Pacific Fury I am releasing
this as open source material for anyone to improve upon 1.8.  As you make changes/fixes feel free to email me with the changes and I'll
add them to the main branch.  If you create your own custom variant of 1.8 I can also create a sub branch for you to upload your work.  
The core idea is that while Pacific Fury is in development, we can still keep the community focussed on having a good naval combat 
experience.

thank you guys for all of your suppord during my work with PSA 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8.  This is dedicated to you guys!
